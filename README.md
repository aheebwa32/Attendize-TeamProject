## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get started quickly with Attendize.

- Version 2.0+ requires PHP 7.1.3 or higher.
- Older Laravel 5.2 branch works with PHP 5.6 to PHP 7.1.

You can use the stable master branch for the latest updates.

#### PHP Requirements:
- PHP >= 7.1.3 (for the master branch)
- OpenSSL PHP Extension
- PDO PHP Extension
- Mbstring PHP Extension
- Tokenizer PHP Extension
- Fileinfo PHP Extension
- GD PHP Extension

#### MySQL Requirements:
- MySQL version 5.7 or higher

### Manual Installation Steps
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Attendize/Attendize
   cd Attendize
   git checkout master
   ```

2. **Copy environment file:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Set file permissions:**
   Ensure the following files/folders are writable by the webserver user (e.g., `www-data`):
   ```bash
   chown -R www-data storage/app
   chown -R www-data storage/framework
   chown -R www-data storage/logs
   chown -R www-data storage/cache
   chown -R www-data bootstrap/cache
   chown -R www-data .env
   chmod -R a+w storage/app
   chmod -R a+w storage/framework
   chmod -R a+w storage/logs
   chmod -R a+w storage/cache
   chmod -R a+w bootstrap/cache
   chmod -R a+w .env
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**
   You need [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed.
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

5. **Generate application key:**
   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

6. **Create MySQL database:**
   Use this database for your Attendize installation and enter the details on the installer page.

7. **Navigate to the installer:**
   Open your browser and go to `http://your-ticket-site.com/install`.

   If the page shows an error, check the logs in `./storage/logs` and ensure proper permissions are set.

### Running Attendize in Docker for Development
**Note**: Docker must be installed on your machine.
